My daughter loves to play with water, but gets more of a kick out of running water, so I went looking for a water table with a pump. I wasn't able to find much, only ones with manual pumps which seemed out of her reach at that age, so I tried making my own.

### Finished Product

### Ingredients

* [A plastic bin to hold the water and the pump](/img/water_table_bottom.JPG)
* [Same size bin, half the height for the top](/img/water_table_top.JPG)
* [A fountain pump](/img/water_table_pump.JPG)
* Some 3/4" PVC tubing
* A threaded connector for the pump to the PVC

### Assembly
The assembly is pretty straightforward

1. Cut a hole in the bottom bin, just wide enough for the pump plug to run through it, just below the lowest point of the top tray.
1. Cut a hole in the top tray where you want the PVC to come up through. Don't worry about making this exact, since you'll want some water to flow back down, but start small.
1. Get creative with the PVC tubing, drill some holes, add some connectors, but don't glue it together, since you'll want to be able to take it apart. When it's dry fitted it still holds together well.

You'll have to adjust the size of the whole in the top tray so that it keeps some water, but doesn't pump out the bottom entirely. I was surprised that this only took us a couple of hours to build and didn't see anything like this on the internet yet.
